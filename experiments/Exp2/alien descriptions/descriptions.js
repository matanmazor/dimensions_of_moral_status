         Positives are able to see things and to learn simple rules.
         They can also tell the difference between very similar objects (for example, very similar shades of red).

         Negatives are able to see things and to learn simple rules.

         In one experiment the scientists trained the aliens to associate a flash of light with a treat.

         Positives were able to make the association between the light and the treat, even when the treat was given as long as one second after the light.

         Negatives were also able to make the association between the light and the treat, but only when the treat was given immediately.`

        Positives like to keep themselves clean. When Positives see a fleck of dirt on their forehead in a mirror, they act to remove it by rubbing their face.

        Negatives also like to keep themselves clean. However, when Negatives see a fleck of dirt on the forehead in a mirror, they ignore the mirror.`

         Positives live in small groups, and they sometimes steal food from their neighbours. When caught doing so, they attempt to hide themselves.

         Negatives also live in small groups, and they also steal food from their neighbours. However, they do not attempt to hide themselves when caught.`
